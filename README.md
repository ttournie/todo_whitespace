This is a simple To-do list web application. To use it you just need to register as a new user on the top right menu.

Adding a new task : Use the form on top of the page.
Mark a task has done : Use the checkbox.
Remove a task : Use the remove link.

All these functionalities do not need refreshing the page (One of the good thing of using NodeJs).
